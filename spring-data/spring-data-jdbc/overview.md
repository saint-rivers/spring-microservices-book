# Spring Data JDBC

## Overview

Spring Data JDBC is an object-relational mapping framework for relational databases.
It helps map SQL query results to Java objects,
but it removes some complexity of other ORM frameworks by
avoiding features like lazy loading, managed lifecycles of entity objects
from the layer of abstraction.

It helps bring back control to the developer,
allowing them to execute read and write operations explicitly,
rather than having an abstraction layer run unexpected SQL statements,
which makes code more predictable.
